# PKS Ninja Labs on Github Milestone #65361 Release Notes

## Overview

The Milestone #65361 sprint addresses only a single bug patch, the expiration of the NSX-T Manager Password documented in [PKS-Ninja Repo Issue #684](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/issues/684)

Please note that the PKS-Ninja-v12-Pks1.5Installed-epmc-0.1 was not impacted by this bug, it is a new template built near the same time as the other templates included below, and so it was included in this release milestone for convenience.

A dashboard view of all the issues related to milestone 65361 can be seen on the [Milestone-65361 Project Board Here](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/projects/8)

This milestone provides a new build and version for each of the associated templates, per the build release notes below. 

As part of the standard build process, each of the templates listed below will be transferred to the "Global - CNABU - Hands-on Labs" Catalog, and also to the "FEL Production - CNABU" catalogs on us04-2-fel-d and us24-2-fel-d, which will enable the templates for the Field Enablement Labs service. The new templates will also be made available on the Quick Demo service and the VMware Learning Platform - Hosted Eval tenant. 

If you need the new templates transferred to any other onecloud org, you will need to initiate the request yourself by following the instructions in the [Transferring a vApp Template Lab Guide](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/Pks1.4/LabGuides/TransferVappTemplate-TT8862)
