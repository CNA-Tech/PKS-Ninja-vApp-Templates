# PKS Ninja Labs on Github Milestone-PKS1.6-TemplateSet Release Notes

## Overview

The Milestone-PKS1.6-TemplateSet sprint provides a complete new set of vApp Templates optimized for the PKS 1.6 release

Each of the steps used to track the build process are documented as PKS-Ninja repo Github issue tickets. A dashboard view of all the issues related to milestone 65361 can be seen on the [Milestone-Pks1.6-TemplateSet Project Board Here](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/projects/9)

As part of the standard build process, each of the templates listed below will be transferred to the "Global - CNABU - Hands-on Labs" Catalog, and also to the "FEL Production - CNABU" catalogs on us04-2-fel-d and us24-2-fel-d, which will enable the templates for the Field Enablement Labs service. The new templates will also be made available on the Quick Demo service and the VMware Learning Platform - Hosted Eval tenant. 

If you need the new templates transferred to any other onecloud org, you will need to initiate the request yourself by following the instructions in the [Transferring a vApp Template Lab Guide](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/Pks1.6/LabGuides/TransferVappTemplate-TT8862)
